 // Time Tracking Dashboard 

 // I had to recreate the Prototype from figma and pull data from the JSON file

 // You can add multiple dates with description.

// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment (Brandon Estrada) - Your website is functional, when clicking "Daily", "Weekly", or "Monthly" it loads the correct data from the JSON file. you got it looking very close to the prototype. There are a few things I would suggest that would make your project look closer to the prototype. You should add a bit of margin or padding underneath "Jeremy Robson" so that the lighter blue extends further down the report card like on the prototype. Also your ellipses ("...") need to turn white when you hover over it like how you have it for "Daily Weekly Monthly". The last suggestion is when on mobile, your line for showing the previous times should be on the right side of the card under the ellipses like the prototype. Other than those minor problems, your project looks good!
